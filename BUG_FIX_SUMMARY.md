# Bug Fix Summary: Download Limit Not Respected

**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

## The Problem

YouTube channel video downloads were not respecting the configured download limit (default: 10 videos). Behavior was inconsistent depending on channel URL format:

- **Peque channel** (`https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmngKdHI41_dHy2FpMS5j-Q`) - Only downloaded **1 video** instead of 10
- **Mrs Rachel channel** (`https://www.youtube.com/@msrachel`) - Correctly downloaded **10 videos**

## Root Cause

The video discovery system uses a fallback strategy with 4 different methods to fetch videos from YouTube:

1. **Uploads playlist** (UC→UU conversion) - `https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=UU...`
2. **Channel videos tab** - `https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxxx/videos`
3. **Original channel URL** - As provided by user
4. **Non-flat extraction** - Full metadata extraction (slow)

### The Bug

When Method #1 (uploads playlist) returned **fewer videos than requested**, the code considered it a "success" and returned without trying the other fallback methods.

**For Peque's channel:** The uploads playlist (UU...) was broken/incomplete and only returned 1 video, even though we asked for 10. The code accepted this and never tried Method #2, which would have worked.

## The Fix

**File:** `backend/app/video_download_service.py`
**Location:** `get_recent_videos()` method, line ~472

**Added smart threshold checking:**
```python
# Check if we got suspiciously few videos compared to what we requested
# If we asked for 10 videos but only got 1-2, try the next fallback method
if len(videos) > 0 and len(videos) < max(3, limit // 3):
    print(f"⚠️  Got only {len(videos)} videos when requesting {limit}, trying next fallback method", flush=True)
    logger.warning(f"Attempt {attempt_num}: Got only {len(videos)}/{limit} videos, trying next fallback")
    continue  # Try next fallback method
```

**How it works:**
- If yt-dlp returns significantly fewer videos than requested (< 33% of limit, minimum threshold of 3)
- Instead of accepting it as "success", continue to the next fallback method
- For Peque: Method #1 returned 1 video → threshold check failed → tried Method #2 → found all 10 videos! ✅

## Test Results

### Before Fix
- Peque: Found **1 video** (❌ WRONG)
- Database: `videos_found=1`

### After Fix
- Peque: Found **10 videos** (✅ CORRECT)
- Downloaded: **9 new videos** (1 skipped as duplicate)
- Database: `videos_found=10, videos_downloaded=9, videos_skipped=1`

## Files Modified

1. **`backend/app/video_download_service.py`** (Line ~472-480)
   - Added threshold check before returning from `get_recent_videos()`
   - Forces fallback attempts when video count is suspiciously low
   - Includes diagnostic print statements (TO BE CLEANED UP - see below)

## Next Steps for Next Claude Session

### 1. Clean Up Debug Code (HIGH PRIORITY)
The fix includes many temporary `print()` statements added for debugging:

**Files to clean:**
- `backend/app/video_download_service.py`
  - Remove all `print(..., flush=True)` statements
  - Keep only the essential `logger.info()` / `logger.warning()` statements
  - Specifically clean up lines around:
    - Line ~398-405 (yt-dlp attempt diagnostics)
    - Line ~416-434 (extraction success diagnostics)
    - Line ~478-479 (fallback threshold warning - KEEP THIS ONE)
    - Line ~489-490 (discovery complete)
    - Line ~628-648 (process channel downloads header)
    - Line ~670-673 (get_recent_videos call)
    - Line ~683-684 (download planning)

**What to keep:**
- Keep the core fix logic (threshold check at line ~477-480)
- Keep the existing `logger.info()` statements that provide useful diagnostics
- Keep ONE print or logger.warning for the threshold fallback (line ~479)

### 2. Commit the Fix

```bash
cd /Users/mrios/Nextcloud/Documents/Development/Projects/ChannelFinWatcher

# Review changes
git diff backend/app/video_download_service.py

# Stage the fix
git add backend/app/video_download_service.py

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "fix(downloads): force fallback when yt-dlp returns too few videos

Some YouTube channels have broken uploads playlists (UC→UU) that only
return 1 video even when requesting more. This fix adds a threshold
check: if yt-dlp returns significantly fewer videos than requested
(< 33% of limit, min 3), continue to the next fallback method instead
of accepting the incomplete result.

Fixes issue where Peque channel only downloaded 1 video instead of 10.

Test results:
- Before: 1 video found
- After: 10 videos found, 9 downloaded (1 duplicate skipped)

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

### 3. Test with Mrs Rachel (OPTIONAL)

Verify the fix doesn't break channels that were already working:
- Trigger manual download for Mrs Rachel channel
- Should still find 10 videos (it worked before with Method #1)
- Confirm no regression

### 4. Remove Dev Compose File (OPTIONAL)

If you want to clean up the temporary development setup:

```bash
cd /Users/mrios/Documents/channelfinwatcher
rm compose.dev.yaml
```

Then rebuild production image once GitHub Actions completes.

### 5. Monitor Production

Once fix is deployed:
- Test both channel types (UC* and @handle formats)
- Monitor logs for fallback warnings
- Check if threshold of 3 (or 33%) is appropriate

## Technical Details

### Threshold Logic

The threshold uses `max(3, limit // 3)`:
- For limit=10: threshold = max(3, 3) = **3 videos**
- For limit=20: threshold = max(3, 6) = **6 videos**
- For limit=5: threshold = max(3, 1) = **3 videos** (minimum)

This ensures:
1. Small limits (5-9) still require at least 3 videos
2. Larger limits scale proportionally (33% rule)
3. Prevents false positives (e.g., accepting 1 video when asking for 10)

### Why Uploads Playlist Fails

YouTube's UC→UU playlist transformation doesn't work reliably for all channels:
- Some channels have incomplete uploads playlists
- YouTube may be deprecating this API endpoint
- Channel videos tab (`/videos`) is more reliable fallback

### Logging Improvements Added

The fix includes extensive diagnostic logging showing:
- Which fallback attempt is running
- How many videos yt-dlp returned
- Whether threshold check triggered fallback
- Which method ultimately succeeded

**These logs are CRITICAL for debugging future channel issues!**

## Architecture Notes

### Fallback Strategy Priority

The current fallback order is optimized for:
1. **Speed** (uploads playlist is fastest)
2. **Reliability** (videos tab as backup)
3. **Completeness** (non-flat as last resort)

With this fix, the system now gracefully degrades through fallbacks when earlier methods return incomplete data.

### Future Improvements (Out of Scope)

1. **Parallel fallback attempts**: Try multiple methods simultaneously, use fastest/most complete
2. **Channel-specific caching**: Remember which method worked last time for this channel
3. **Adaptive thresholds**: Learn expected video counts per channel over time
4. **Health monitoring**: Track fallback frequency to detect YouTube API changes
