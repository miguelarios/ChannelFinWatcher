# User Story: Channel Video Downloads

## Section 1: Story Definition

### Feature
Download recent videos from monitored channels sequentially with basic status tracking

### User Story
- **As a** user managing monitored YouTube channels
- **I want** to automatically download the most recent videos from each channel
- **So that** I have offline access to new content without manual intervention

### Context
Core download functionality that makes channel monitoring useful. This initial implementation focuses on reliable, sequential downloads with proper file organization, building on the metadata management from Story 4.

### Functional Requirements

#### [x] Scenario: Download Single Channel Videos - Happy Path
- **Given** a channel is configured and enabled
  - And the channel has metadata extracted (from Story 4)
  - And download limit is set (e.g., 10 videos)
- **When** download process is triggered for the channel
  - And system queries for recent videos using yt-dlp
- **Then** system downloads up to 10 most recent videos sequentially
  - And videos are organized in Jellyfin-compatible directory structure
  - And already downloaded videos are skipped using archive.txt
  - And download status is tracked in database
  - And last_check timestamp is updated

#### [x] Scenario: No New Videos Available
- **Given** a channel with all recent videos already downloaded
  - And the download archive contains existing video IDs
- **When** download process runs for the channel
- **Then** no downloads are initiated
  - And last_check timestamp is updated
  - And download history shows "0 new videos found"

#### [x] Scenario: Individual Video Download Failure
- **Given** channel has multiple videos to download
  - And one video fails (network issue, unavailable, private)
- **When** video download encounters error
- **Then** error is logged with specific details
  - And remaining videos continue downloading sequentially
  - And failed video is marked with error status in database
  - And overall channel download completes with partial success

### Non-functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Sequential video downloads complete efficiently using yt-dlp fragment downloads (-N 4)
- **Security:** Download operations handle age-restricted content using cookie file
- **Reliability:** Individual video failures don't stop processing remaining videos in channel
- **Usability:** Download status visible through database tracking and channel UI updates

### Dependencies
- **Blocked by:** Story 1 (channel management), Story 4 (channel metadata)
- **Blocks:** Story 10 (real-time progress UI), Story 7 (automatic cleanup)

### Engineering TODOs
- [x] Design VideoDownloadService following YouTubeService pattern for sequential downloads
- [x] Implement recent video detection using yt-dlp extract_info with archive.txt integration
- [x] Configure yt-dlp with exact parameters from reference bash script for Jellyfin structure
- [x] Design simple download tracking using existing Download/DownloadHistory models

## Definition of Done

### Must Have
- [x] Videos download successfully using yt-dlp with Jellyfin directory structure
- [x] Sequential downloads work reliably for individual channels
- [x] Downloads tracked in existing database models with basic status
- [x] Archive.txt prevents duplicate downloads
- [x] Individual video failures don't stop remaining downloads

### Should Have  
- [x] Basic UI shows download status on channel cards
- [x] Simple test coverage for core download functionality
- [x] Basic logging for troubleshooting download issues
- [x] Manual download trigger works through API

### Implementation Notes

**Key Fix Applied**: Implemented flat-playlist approach for video discovery to solve the original issue where video downloads weren't being triggered after metadata extraction. The system now uses lightweight queries (equivalent to `yt-dlp --flat-playlist`) to get video IDs quickly, then performs full downloads sequentially.

**Architecture**: Separates concerns between video discovery (fast, minimal requests) and video downloading (heavy, full metadata extraction) to avoid bot detection and improve reliability.

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - All scenarios working as designed, including automatic triggering after metadata extraction and proper handling of already-downloaded videos via archive.txt.

### Notes for Future
- Concurrent channel processing (multiple channels simultaneously)
- Real-time progress updates and WebSocket integration
- Advanced retry logic with exponential backoff
- Download queue management and priority system
- Performance optimization and bandwidth throttling

Basic channel configuration with download settings:

```yaml
# config/config.yaml
channels:
  - url: "https://www.youtube.com/@MrsRachel"
    name: "Ms Rachel - Toddler Learning Videos"  
    limit: 10                    # Number of recent videos to keep
    enabled: true                # Enable/disable downloads
    quality_preset: "best"       # Video quality: best, 1080p, 720p, 480p
    schedule_override: null      # Custom schedule (future enhancement)

### Target Directory Structure (from Story 4)
```
/media/
    Channel Name [channel_id]/                                                 
        cover.ext                                                              
        backdrop.ext                                                           
        Channel Name [channel_id].info.json                                    
        [Year:YYYY]/                                                           
            Channel Name - YYYYMMDD - Title [video_id]/                        
                Channel Name - YYYYMMDD - Title [video_id].nfo                 
                Channel Name - YYYYMMDD - Title [video_id]-thumb.jpg           
                Channel Name - YYYYMMDD - Title [video_id].info.json           
                Channel Name - YYYYMMDD - Title [video_id].mkv                 
                Channel Name - YYYYMMDD - Title [video_id].[subtitles ext]     
```

### Recent Video Detection Algorithm (Simplified)
```python
def get_recent_videos(channel_url, limit=10):
    """
    Query channel for recent videos without downloading.
    Simple implementation for initial Story 5.
    """
    opts = {
        'quiet': True,
        'extract_flat': False,
        'playlistend': limit,
    }
    
    with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(opts) as ydl:
        info = ydl.extract_info(channel_url, download=False)
        return info.get('entries', [])[:limit]
```

### Basic Download Status Tracking
```python
# Simple status tracking using existing database models
# Download.status: 'pending' -> 'downloading' -> 'completed'/'failed'
# DownloadHistory tracks overall channel download run

def update_download_status(download_id, status, error_message=None):
    """Update download record with current status."""
    # Implementation uses existing database patterns from other services
    pass
```

### Database Status Flow (Simplified)
```
Download Status Flow:
pending -> downloading -> completed (success)
pending -> downloading -> failed (with error_message)

DownloadHistory Status Flow:
running -> completed (with video count and duration)
running -> failed (with error summary)
```

### Basic Error Categories
```python
# Common errors to handle in initial implementation
- yt_dlp.DownloadError: Network/availability issues
- FileExistsError: Duplicate file handling
- PermissionError: File system access issues  
- OSError: Storage/disk space problems

# Error handling strategy: Log error, mark as failed, continue to next video
```

### yt-dlp Basic Configuration
```python
# Minimal configuration for reliable downloads
ydl_opts = {
    'outtmpl': 'Channel/Year/VideoFolder/VideoFile.%(ext)s',
    'format': 'bv*+ba/b',
    'writeinfojson': True,
    'writethumbnail': True,
    'embedthumbnail': True,
    'merge_output_format': 'mkv',
    'download_archive': 'archive.txt',
    'concurrent_fragments': 4  # Only concurrency in initial version
}
```
