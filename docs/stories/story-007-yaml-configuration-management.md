# US-006: YAML Configuration Management

## Story Description

As a user, I want to manage channels through a YAML file so that I can easily backup, version control, and bulk edit my configuration.

## Context

Power users need the ability to manage channel configurations through a structured file format. This enables backup strategies, version control integration, bulk operations, and easier deployment across environments.

## Value

Enables advanced configuration management and easier setup replication for technical users who prefer file-based configuration.

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] System reads channel configuration from YAML file on startup
- [ ] Web UI changes are reflected in YAML file automatically
- [ ] Manual YAML edits are detected and loaded without application restart
- [ ] YAML changes take precedence over database state on conflicts
- [ ] Invalid YAML shows clear error messages in logs and UI

### YAML Structure Support
- [ ] Channel definitions with URL, limit, enabled status, quality presets
- [ ] Global settings including default limits and system configuration
- [ ] Schedule overrides per channel
- [ ] Notification settings and webhook configurations
- [ ] Comments preserved during automated updates

### File Watching and Sync
- [ ] File system monitoring for YAML changes
- [ ] Automatic reload within 5 seconds of file modification
- [ ] Graceful handling of temporary file states during editing
- [ ] Backup creation before applying YAML changes
- [ ] Conflict resolution when both UI and file modified simultaneously

### Validation and Error Handling
- [ ] Schema validation for YAML structure
- [ ] URL format validation for channel entries
- [ ] Range validation for video limits and settings
- [ ] Clear error messages with line numbers for syntax errors
- [ ] Partial loading when some entries are invalid

## Engineering Tasks

### Backend Configuration System
- [ ] Create YAMLConfigService for file operations
- [ ] Implement Pydantic models for configuration schema validation
- [ ] Add file system watcher for automatic reload detection
- [ ] Create configuration merger for database/YAML conflicts
- [ ] Add validation pipeline with detailed error reporting

### File Operations
- [ ] Safe YAML file reading with encoding detection
- [ ] Atomic file writing to prevent corruption
- [ ] Configuration file backup before modifications
- [ ] File locking during write operations
- [ ] Permission verification for configuration directory

### Database Synchronization
- [ ] Configuration sync service for startup initialization
- [ ] Bi-directional sync between database and YAML
- [ ] Conflict resolution strategy (YAML precedence)
- [ ] Change detection and differential updates
- [ ] Migration utilities for configuration format changes

### API Integration
- [ ] Configuration reload endpoint for manual refresh
- [ ] Validation endpoint for YAML syntax checking
- [ ] Configuration export endpoint for backup generation
- [ ] Status endpoint showing configuration source and health

### Monitoring and Logging
- [ ] Configuration change logging with timestamps
- [ ] Validation error reporting with context
- [ ] File modification event logging
- [ ] Configuration source tracking (UI vs YAML)

## Technical Considerations

### File Format Design
- Use standard YAML 1.2 specification
- Design schema for extensibility and backward compatibility
- Include metadata fields for versioning and validation
- Support environment variable substitution

### Concurrency Handling
- Handle concurrent access from multiple processes
- Implement file locking during critical operations
- Manage race conditions between file watcher and manual operations
- Ensure atomic updates to prevent partial state

### Error Recovery
- Graceful degradation when YAML is invalid
- Fallback to database configuration on file errors
- Automatic backup restoration for corrupted files
- Clear error reporting without breaking application functionality

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient file watching without excessive polling
- Minimize full configuration reloads
- Cache parsed configuration for frequent access
- Optimize validation pipeline for large configurations

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Basic channel management system (database and API)
- File system access with read/write permissions
- Configuration directory structure established

### Related Stories
- US-001 through US-005: All channel management features sync with YAML
- US-003: Global Default Video Limit (stored in YAML settings)
- US-004: Toggle Channel Enable/Disable (status persisted in YAML)

## Definition of Done

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] System reads complete configuration from YAML file on startup
- [ ] Web UI modifications automatically update YAML file
- [ ] Manual YAML edits are detected and applied without restart
- [ ] Invalid YAML configurations show clear error messages

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] YAML file changes detected within 5 seconds
- [ ] Configuration validation completes within 2 seconds
- [ ] File operations are atomic and prevent corruption
- [ ] Database and YAML stay synchronized bidirectionally

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Test YAML parsing with various valid and invalid configurations
- [ ] Verify file watching works across different operating systems
- [ ] Test concurrent access scenarios (UI + manual file editing)
- [ ] Validate schema changes don't break existing configurations

### Error Handling
- [ ] Graceful degradation when YAML file is unavailable
- [ ] Clear error messages for syntax and validation errors
- [ ] Automatic recovery from temporary file corruption
- [ ] Fallback mechanisms preserve system functionality
