# User Story: Channel Metadata Management

## Section 1: Story Definition

### Feature
Download and store YouTube channel metadata with organized directory structure for media management

### User Story
- **As a** ChannelFinWatcher user
- **I want** the system to download channel metadata and create organized directories
- **So that** I have structured storage with channel information for media server integration

### Context
When channels are added, we need to collect comprehensive metadata about the channel and establish a proper directory structure in the media folder. This enables better organization, media server compatibility, and provides essential channel information for future features like thumbnails, descriptions, and channel artwork.

### Functional Requirements

#### [x] Scenario: Download Channel Metadata - Happy Path
- **Given** a valid YouTube channel URL has been submitted
  - And the channel metadata has not been downloaded yet
  - And the /media directory is accessible
  - And the channel directory doesn't yet exist
  - And yt-dlp Python library is available
- **When** the button is clicked for `Add Channel for Monitoring` in the UI
- **Then** the metadata download process is triggered using yt-dlp Python extract_info() method
  - And the channel_id is extracted from the metadata response
  - And the channel_id is checked against existing channels in database to prevent duplicates
  - And if duplicate channel_id found, the operation is rejected with clear error message "Channel already being monitored"
  - And if unique, the process continues with directory creation and metadata storage

#### [x] Scenario: Directory Structure Creation
- **Given** channel metadata has been successfully downloaded
  - And the channel name is "Mrs. Rachel - Toddler Learning Videos"
  - And the channel ID is "UCG2CL6EUjG8TVT1Tpl9nJdg"
  - And the channel ID has been verified as unique in the system
- **When** the directory creation process runs
- **Then** a directory is created at `/media/Ms Rachel - Toddler Learning Videos [UCG2CL6EUjG8TVT1Tpl9nJdg]/`
  - And the channel ID is included for uniqueness

#### [x] Scenario: Metadata JSON Structure
- **Given** channel metadata has been extracted using yt-dlp extract_info()
- **When** the metadata is processed and saved to JSON file
- **Then** the complete channel metadata is saved including: channel_id, title, description, channel_follower_count, thumbnails array, and all other channel fields
  - And the `entries` key is removed to reduce file size from 24MB to ~5KB
  - And the file is saved as `Channel Name [channel_id].info.json`
  - And thumbnails array contains `avatar_uncropped` and `banner_uncropped` URLs directly accessible
  - And timestamp of metadata retrieval is included via epoch field

#### [x] Scenario: Cover image is downloaded
- **Given** channel metadata has been extracted using yt-dlp extract_info()
  - And the channel name is "Mrs. Rachel - Toddler Learning Videos"
  - And the channel ID is "UCG2CL6EUjG8TVT1Tpl9nJdg"
  - And the thumbnails array is available in the extracted metadata
- **When** the cover image download process runs
- **Then** the cover image URL is found directly in thumbnails array where id = `avatar_uncropped`
  - And the image is downloaded from that URL
  - And the file is named `cover.ext` in the location `/media/Ms Rachel - Toddler Learning Videos [UCG2CL6EUjG8TVT1Tpl9nJdg]/`

#### [x] Scenario: Backdrop image is downloaded
- **Given** channel metadata has been extracted using yt-dlp extract_info()
  - And the channel name is "Mrs. Rachel - Toddler Learning Videos"
  - And the channel ID is "UCG2CL6EUjG8TVT1Tpl9nJdg"
  - And the thumbnails array is available in the extracted metadata
- **When** the backdrop image download process runs
- **Then** the backdrop image URL is found directly in thumbnails array where id = `banner_uncropped`
  - And the image is downloaded from that URL
  - And the file is named `backdrop.ext` in the location `/media/Ms Rachel - Toddler Learning Videos [UCG2CL6EUjG8TVT1Tpl9nJdg]/`

#### [x] Scenario: Handle Existing Directories
- **Given** a channel directory already exists
  - And channel metadata is being refreshed
  - And channel is being monitored
- **When** the metadata download process runs
- **Then** channel metadata is extracted using yt-dlp Python extract_info() method
  - And channel metadata JSON file is updated with new information
  - And metadata saved in database is refreshed with latest data
  - And directory structure remains intact
  - And cover and backdrop images are redownloaded and overwrite existing file if any

#### [x] Scenario: Error Handling - Invalid Channel
- **Given** a channel ID that no longer exists or is private
- **When** metadata download is attempted
- **Then** an error is logged with specific failure reason
  - And the database is updated with error status
  - And no directory or files are created
  - And the system continues processing other channels

### Non-functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Metadata download completes within 30 seconds per channel
- **Security:** Image downloads validate URLs, file types, and enforce size limits to prevent malicious content
- **Reliability:** Failed metadata downloads can be retried without data corruption
- **Storage:** JSON files optimized to ~5KB by removing entries key to minimize disk usage

### Dependencies
- **Blocked by:** Story 1 (Add Channel via Web UI) - need channels in system
- **Blocks:** Future video download stories - need organized structure first

### Engineering TODOs
- [x] Determine optimal directory naming convention for media servers (Jellyfin compatibility)
- [x] Define metadata refresh strategy (manual vs automatic scheduling)
- [x] Establish storage cleanup policies for old metadata and images
- [x] Design error recovery patterns for partial metadata failures

```

### yt-dlp Python Library for Complete Channel Metadata
```python
# Extract complete channel metadata with single extract_info() call
import json
import yt_dlp

def extract_and_save_channel_metadata(url, output_path):
    ydl_opts = {
        'quiet': True,
        'no_warnings': True,
        'playlistend': 10,  # Limit entries for faster extraction
    }
    
    with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
        # Extract all channel info without downloading
        info = ydl.extract_info(url, download=False)
        
        # Remove entries to reduce file size from 24MB to ~5KB
        if 'entries' in info:
            del info['entries']
        
        # Sanitize for JSON serialization
        sanitized_info = ydl.sanitize_info(info)
        
        # Save to file
        with open(output_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            json.dump(sanitized_info, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)
        
        return sanitized_info

# Usage example:
# metadata = extract_and_save_channel_metadata(
#     "https://www.youtube.com/@msrachel",
#     "/media/channel_name/channel_info.json"
# )
# 
# # Access thumbnails directly:
# for thumb in metadata.get('thumbnails', []):
#     if thumb.get('id') == 'avatar_uncropped':
#         cover_url = thumb['url']
#     elif thumb.get('id') == 'banner_uncropped':
#         backdrop_url = thumb['url']
```


### Optimized Metadata Processing
```bash
# Single extract_info() call provides:
# 1. Complete channel metadata (channel_id, title, description, subscriber_count)
# 2. Direct thumbnail access (avatar_uncropped, banner_uncropped)
# 3. Compact file size (~5KB after removing entries)

# Example directory structure:
# /media/Ms Rachel - Toddler Learning Videos [UCG2CL6EUjG8TVT1Tpl9nJdg]/
#   â”œâ”€â”€ Ms Rachel - Toddler Learning Videos [UCG2CL6EUjG8TVT1Tpl9nJdg].info.json  (5KB)
#   â”œâ”€â”€ cover.jpg     (from avatar_uncropped)
#   â””â”€â”€ backdrop.jpg  (from banner_uncropped)
```

    }
}
```

#### Image Metadata Download

**Cover image download**
From json file example above the image file would come from `thumbnails[int].url` where id = `avatar_uncropped`

```bash
# Example filename
`/media/Ms Rachel - Toddler Learning Videos [UCG2CL6EUjG8TVT1Tpl9nJdg]/cover.[ext]`
```

**Backdrop image download**
From json file example above the image file would come from `thumbnails[int].url` where id = `banner_uncropped`

```bash
# Example filename
`/media/Ms Rachel - Toddler Learning Videos [UCG2CL6EUjG8TVT1Tpl9nJdg]/backdrop.[ext]`
```

### Filesystem Safe Name Generation (Python)
```python
import re
import unicodedata

def make_filesystem_safe(name, max_length=100):
    """Convert channel name to filesystem-safe directory name, preserving spaces."""
    # Normalize unicode characters
    name = unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', name)
    
    # Replace problematic filesystem characters but preserve spaces
    name = re.sub(r'[<>:"/\\|?*]', '', name)  # Remove problematic chars
    name = re.sub(r'\.+$', '', name)  # Remove trailing dots
    name = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', name)  # Collapse multiple spaces to single space
    name = name.strip()  # Remove leading/trailing whitespace
    
    # Truncate if too long, but preserve channel ID space
    if len(name) > max_length:
        name = name[:max_length].strip()
    
    return name

# Example usage:
# "Mrs. Rachel - Toddler Learning Videos" -> "Mrs Rachel - Toddler Learning Videos"
```

### Database Migration Example
```sql
-- Add metadata management fields to channels table
ALTER TABLE channels ADD COLUMN metadata_path VARCHAR(500);
ALTER TABLE channels ADD COLUMN directory_path VARCHAR(500);
ALTER TABLE channels ADD COLUMN last_metadata_update TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE channels ADD COLUMN metadata_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending';

-- Index for efficient metadata status queries
CREATE INDEX idx_channels_metadata_status ON channels(metadata_status);
```

### Error Handling Scenarios
Common error cases to handle:
- Channel deleted/private: Update database status, don't create directories
- Network timeout: Retry with exponential backoff
- Filesystem permission issues: Log error, alert admin
- Invalid JSON from yt-dlp: Use fallback metadata structure
- Disk space full: Graceful failure with clear error message
