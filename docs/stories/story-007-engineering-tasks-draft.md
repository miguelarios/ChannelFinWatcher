## Section 2: Engineering Tasks

### Task Breakdown
*Each task follows INVEST principles (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)*

### **TASK DEPENDENCIES & SEQUENCING**

```
LAYER 1 (Foundation):
  DB-001 (4 hours)
    ↓

LAYER 2 (Core Services) - Can be done in parallel:
  ├─ BE-001 (1-2 days) - depends on DB-001
  ├─ BE-002 (1 day) - independent
  ├─ BE-003 (1 day) - depends on DB-001
  └─ BE-004 (1-2 days) - depends on BE-001, BE-003
       ↓

LAYER 3 (API & Integration):
  ├─ BE-005 (1 day) - depends on BE-001, BE-002
  ├─ BE-006 (4 hours) - depends on BE-001
  └─ BE-007 (1 day) - depends on BE-003, existing manual trigger endpoint [NEW]
       ↓

LAYER 4 (Frontend) - Can be done in parallel:
  ├─ FE-001 (1-2 days) - depends on BE-005, BE-007
  ├─ FE-002 (1 day) - depends on BE-005
  └─ FE-003 (4-6 hours) - depends on FE-001
       ↓

LAYER 5 (Testing) - Can be done in parallel:
  ├─ TEST-001 (1-2 days) - depends on BE-001 through BE-004
  ├─ TEST-002 (2-3 days) - depends on BE-001 through BE-007 [UPDATED]
  └─ TEST-003 (1 day) - depends on BE-006
       ↓

LAYER 6 (Documentation) - Can be done in parallel:
  ├─ DOC-001 (4-6 hours) - depends on FE-001
  ├─ DOC-002 (2-3 hours) - depends on BE-005, BE-007
  └─ DOC-003 (3-4 hours) - depends on all implementation tasks
```

**Critical Path:** DB-001 → BE-001 → BE-004 → BE-007 → FE-001 → TEST-002

**Estimated Total Effort:** 13-18 days for single developer, 9-12 days with 2 developers

**Parallel Workstreams:**
- **Stream 1 (Backend):** DB-001 → BE-001 → BE-004 → BE-006 → TEST-002 → DOC-003
- **Stream 2 (Utilities & Integration):** BE-002 → BE-003 → BE-007 → TEST-001
- **Stream 3 (Frontend):** (waits for BE-005, BE-007) → FE-001 → FE-003 → FE-002 → DOC-001
- **Stream 4 (Validation):** TEST-003 → DOC-002

### **RISK MITIGATION & ALTERNATIVES**

#### **Risk: POC Code Adaptation**
- **Mitigation:** Reference code provided in story is production-ready. Follow patterns closely.
- **Alternative:** If issues arise, POC code can be run again for debugging comparison.

#### **Risk: Docker Volume Persistence Issues**
- **Mitigation:** TEST-003 verifies persistence before frontend work begins.
- **Alternative:** If SQLite issues occur, can fall back to PostgreSQL job store (requires docker-compose update).

#### **Risk: Frontend Validation UX Complexity**
- **Mitigation:** FE-003 creates reusable component isolating complexity.
- **Alternative:** Simplify to validation on save only (no real-time feedback) to reduce scope.

#### **Risk: Overlap Prevention Edge Cases**
- **Mitigation:** TEST-001 and TEST-002 specifically test concurrent scenarios.
- **Alternative:** If database flags unreliable, can add Redis-based locking (requires new service).

#### **Risk: Integration with Existing Download Service**
- **Mitigation:** video_download_service.process_channel_downloads() already tested in previous stories.
- **Alternative:** None needed - existing service is stable and designed for this use case.

### **MVP vs POST-MVP CONSIDERATIONS**

**MVP Scope (Required for Story Completion):**
- All tasks DB-001 through FE-003 (including BE-007 and real-time validation)
- TEST-001 and TEST-002 (core testing)
- DOC-001 (user guide)

**Post-MVP Enhancements (Nice to Have):**
- TEST-003 (Docker persistence testing) - can be manual testing initially
- DOC-002, DOC-003 (enhanced documentation) - can be basic initially
- Advanced monitoring dashboard widgets
- Per-channel schedule overrides (future story)
- Schedule history and analytics

**Recommended MVP Implementation Order:**
1. Complete LAYER 1 & 2 (database + backend services) - 3-4 days
2. Complete LAYER 3 (API integration including BE-007) - 2 days
3. Complete FE-001 and FE-003 (settings UI with real-time validation) - 2-3 days
4. Complete TEST-001, TEST-002 (core testing) - 3-4 days
5. Complete DOC-001 (user guide) - 0.5 days
6. **MVP Complete** - remaining tasks can be done incrementally

Total MVP Timeline: **8-12 days**
