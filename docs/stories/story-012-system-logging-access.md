# US-011: System Logging Access

## Story Description

As a user, I want to access application logs through Docker logs so that I can troubleshoot issues when downloads fail.

## Context

When downloads fail or the system behaves unexpectedly, users need access to detailed logs for troubleshooting. Since this is a Docker-deployed application, logs should be accessible through standard Docker logging mechanisms while providing sufficient detail for problem diagnosis.

## Value

Enables self-service troubleshooting and system debugging by providing accessible, detailed logs through standard Docker interfaces.

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Log Output Requirements
- [ ] Application writes structured logs to stdout for Docker log collection
- [ ] Logs include timestamps, log levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR), and clear messages
- [ ] Error logs contain sufficient context for troubleshooting
- [ ] Log format is consistent and easily readable
- [ ] Sensitive information (URLs, file paths) are appropriately sanitized

### Log Content Standards
- [ ] Download start/completion events logged with channel and video details
- [ ] Error conditions logged with error codes and context
- [ ] System startup/shutdown events logged clearly
- [ ] Configuration changes logged with before/after values
- [ ] Cleanup operations logged with files removed and reasons

### Log Levels and Categories
- [ ] INFO: Normal operations (downloads, startup, configuration changes)
- [ ] WARNING: Non-critical issues (retries, temporary failures)
- [ ] ERROR: Critical failures (download failures, system errors)
- [ ] DEBUG: Detailed diagnostic information (optional, configurable)
- [ ] Category prefixes for different system components

### Docker Integration
- [ ] All logs output to stdout/stderr for Docker capture
- [ ] Log rotation handled by Docker logging drivers
- [ ] Compatible with common log aggregation systems
- [ ] JSON structured logging option for automated processing
- [ ] Configurable log levels via environment variables

### Troubleshooting Support
- [ ] Error messages include actionable suggestions when possible
- [ ] Correlation IDs for tracking related operations
- [ ] Stack traces included for unexpected errors
- [ ] Network errors include retry information
- [ ] File system errors include permission and path details

## Engineering Tasks

### Logging Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up structured logging framework (Python logging + structlog)
- [ ] Configure log formatters for consistent output
- [ ] Implement log level configuration via environment variables
- [ ] Add correlation ID generation for request tracking
- [ ] Create logging utilities for common patterns

### Application Integration
- [ ] Add logging to download system with progress markers
- [ ] Log channel management operations (add, remove, enable/disable)
- [ ] Add error logging with context and troubleshooting hints
- [ ] Log configuration changes and file operations
- [ ] Add startup/shutdown logging with system information

### Error Handling Enhancement
- [ ] Enhance exception handling to include logging
- [ ] Add structured error information to logs
- [ ] Implement error categorization for easier filtering
- [ ] Add retry logic logging with attempt counts
- [ ] Log resource usage and performance metrics

### Log Formatting and Security
- [ ] Implement consistent log message formatting
- [ ] Add sensitive data sanitization (URLs, file paths)
- [ ] Create log message templates for consistency
- [ ] Add request/response logging for API endpoints
- [ ] Implement log level filtering to reduce noise

### Configuration Management
- [ ] Add environment variables for log level control
- [ ] Implement JSON vs plain text log format selection
- [ ] Add component-specific log level configuration
- [ ] Create log configuration validation
- [ ] Add runtime log level adjustment capability

## Technical Considerations

### Log Performance
- Ensure logging doesn't significantly impact application performance
- Use asynchronous logging for high-frequency operations
- Implement log buffering for efficient I/O
- Consider log sampling for very verbose operations

### Log Security
- Sanitize sensitive information without losing troubleshooting value
- Avoid logging authentication tokens or credentials
- Be careful with file paths that might contain sensitive information
- Consider privacy implications of logged YouTube URLs

### Log Structure
- Use consistent field names across all log entries
- Include contextual information (channel, video, operation type)
- Make logs easily parseable by both humans and machines
- Consider forward compatibility for log format changes

### Docker Compatibility
- Ensure logs work properly with various Docker logging drivers
- Test with common log aggregation systems (ELK, Fluentd, etc.)
- Verify log rotation and retention work as expected
- Handle log output buffering issues

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Docker deployment infrastructure
- Python logging framework setup
- Application components that need logging instrumentation
- Error handling patterns established
