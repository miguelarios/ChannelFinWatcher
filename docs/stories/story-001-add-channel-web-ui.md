# US-001: Add Channel via Web UI

## Story Description

As a user, I want to add a YouTube channel URL through the web interface so that I can start monitoring it for new videos.

## Context

This is the primary entry point for users to begin monitoring YouTube channels. The web interface should provide immediate feedback and validation to ensure successful channel addition without requiring technical knowledge or file editing.

## Value

Enables quick channel addition without file editing, making the application accessible to non-technical users.

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] User can access a "Add Channel" form in the web interface
- [ ] Form accepts YouTube channel URLs in multiple formats:
  - `https://www.youtube.com/c/ChannelName`
  - `https://www.youtube.com/@ChannelHandle` 
  - `https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC...`
- [ ] System validates URL format before processing
- [ ] System extracts channel information (name, ID, subscriber count)
- [ ] Channel appears in monitoring list immediately after addition

### Default Settings
- [ ] New channels are created with 10 video limit (global default)
- [ ] New channels are enabled by default
- [ ] System assigns appropriate download quality preset ("best")

### User Feedback
- [ ] Success message displays channel name and confirmation
- [ ] Clear error messages for invalid URLs
- [ ] Loading indicator during channel validation process
- [ ] Form validation prevents empty submissions

### Error Handling
- [ ] Invalid URLs show specific error messages
- [ ] Private/unavailable channels display appropriate warnings
- [ ] Duplicate channels are detected and prevented
- [ ] Network errors are handled gracefully

## Engineering Tasks

### Frontend (NextJS)
- [ ] Create AddChannelForm component with form validation
- [ ] Implement URL format validation regex patterns
- [ ] Add loading states and success/error notifications
- [ ] Create channel display component for confirmation
- [ ] Add form submission handling with API integration

### Backend (FastAPI)
- [ ] Create POST /api/channels endpoint
- [ ] Implement YouTube URL parsing and validation
- [ ] Add yt-dlp integration for channel information extraction
- [ ] Create channel database model and CRUD operations
- [ ] Add duplicate channel detection logic
- [ ] Implement error handling and response formatting

### Database
- [ ] Design channels table schema (id, url, name, channel_id, limit, enabled, created_at)
- [ ] Add unique constraints on channel URLs
- [ ] Create database migration scripts

## Technical Considerations

### YouTube API Limitations
- No official API usage - rely on yt-dlp for channel information
- Handle rate limiting and temporary failures gracefully
- Consider caching channel metadata for performance

### URL Parsing Strategy
- Support multiple YouTube URL formats
- Extract canonical channel ID for consistent identification
- Validate channel accessibility before database storage

### State Management
- Update frontend channel list immediately after successful addition
- Sync with YAML configuration file
- Handle concurrent additions properly

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- FastAPI backend framework setup
- NextJS frontend framework setup
- Database connection and schema
- yt-dlp integration

### Dependent Stories
- This story is independent and can be implemented first
- Other stories will build upon the channel management foundation

## Definition of Done

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] User can successfully add valid YouTube channels via web form
- [ ] Channel information is extracted and stored correctly
- [ ] Invalid inputs show appropriate error messages
- [ ] Channel appears in monitoring dashboard immediately

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] API endpoint responds within 5 seconds for valid channels
- [ ] Frontend form validation prevents invalid submissions
- [ ] Database constraints prevent duplicate channels
- [ ] Error handling covers all edge cases

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Manual testing with various YouTube URL formats
- [ ] Error scenarios tested (invalid URLs, network issues, duplicates)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness confirmed

### Documentation
- [ ] API endpoint documented with request/response examples
- [ ] Component usage documented for future developers
- [ ] Error codes and messages documented
