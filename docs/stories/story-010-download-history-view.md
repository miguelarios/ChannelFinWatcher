# US-009: Download History View

## Story Description

As a user, I want to view the most recent download completions so that I can verify what content was successfully added.

## Context

Users need visibility into completed downloads to verify system activity, troubleshoot issues, and understand what content has been successfully added to their library. This historical view complements the real-time progress monitoring.

## Value

Enables verification of system activity and troubleshooting by providing a clear record of recent download completions.

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### Core History Display
- [ ] Shows last 50 completed downloads with timestamp, channel, video title, and status
- [ ] Downloads sorted by completion time (newest first)
- [ ] Failed downloads clearly marked with error indicators
- [ ] History persists across application restarts
- [ ] Includes file size and download duration information

### Download Entry Information
- [ ] Video title with link to actual file location
- [ ] Channel name and associated channel page
- [ ] Completion timestamp with relative time ("2 hours ago")
- [ ] Download status (success, failed, partial)
- [ ] File size and download duration

### Status Indicators
- [ ] Visual distinction between successful and failed downloads
- [ ] Error details available for failed downloads
- [ ] Partial download indicators for interrupted transfers
- [ ] Re-download capability for failed items
- [ ] Cleanup status (if video was later auto-deleted)

### Filtering and Search
- [ ] Filter by channel to see specific channel history
- [ ] Filter by status (success, failed, all)
- [ ] Search by video title or channel name
- [ ] Date range filtering for historical analysis
- [ ] Clear all filters option

### Pagination and Performance
- [ ] Paginated display for large download histories
- [ ] Lazy loading for smooth scrolling experience
- [ ] Configurable page size (25, 50, 100 items)
- [ ] Total download count display
- [ ] Jump to page functionality

## Engineering Tasks

### Frontend (NextJS)
- [ ] Create DownloadHistory component with pagination
- [ ] Design DownloadHistoryItem component for individual entries
- [ ] Implement filtering and search functionality
- [ ] Add status indicators and error detail modals
- [ ] Create responsive table/card layout for different screen sizes
- [ ] Add export functionality for download history

### Backend (FastAPI)
- [ ] Create GET /api/downloads/history endpoint with pagination
- [ ] Implement filtering by channel, status, and date range
- [ ] Add search functionality across video titles and channels
- [ ] Include error details and diagnostic information
- [ ] Add download statistics aggregation

### Database Design
- [ ] Design download_history table with comprehensive fields
- [ ] Add indexes for efficient filtering and sorting
- [ ] Include error logging and diagnostic information
- [ ] Track file paths for link generation
- [ ] Add cleanup tracking for auto-deleted videos

### Integration with Download System
- [ ] Record download completions in history table
- [ ] Capture error details and diagnostic information
- [ ] Track download metrics (size, duration, speed)
- [ ] Update history when videos are auto-cleaned up
- [ ] Link history entries to channel configurations

### Data Management
- [ ] Implement history retention policy (configurable limit)
- [ ] Add history cleanup for very old entries
- [ ] Ensure referential integrity with channels
- [ ] Handle orphaned records from deleted channels

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Use database indexing for efficient queries
- Implement cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- Cache frequently accessed data appropriately
- Optimize joins between downloads and channels tables

### Data Retention
- Balance between useful history and database size
- Implement configurable retention policies
- Handle history cleanup without affecting system performance
- Preserve error information for troubleshooting

### Error Information
- Store sufficient error context for debugging
- Sanitize sensitive information in error logs
- Provide actionable error messages for users
- Link to relevant troubleshooting documentation

### User Experience
- Ensure fast loading even with large download histories
- Provide meaningful loading states during data retrieval
- Handle empty states gracefully
- Make error information accessible but not overwhelming

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- Download system that records completion events
- Database schema for download tracking
- Channel management system for association
- Basic pagination and filtering components
