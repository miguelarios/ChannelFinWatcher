# User Story: Infrastructure Setup

## Section 1: Story Definition

### Feature
Establish FastAPI + NextJS development environment with Docker deployment and database schema for YouTube channel monitoring application.

### User Story
- **As a** developer
- **I want** a complete development infrastructure with FastAPI backend, NextJS frontend, and Docker deployment
- **So that** I can efficiently develop user-facing features on a solid technical foundation

### Functional Requirements

#### Scenario: [x] Development Environment Startup - Happy Path
- **Given** Docker and Node.js are installed on the development machine
  - And the project repository is cloned locally
  - And all environment variables are configured
- **When** the developer runs `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`
  - And waits for all services to start
- **Then** the FastAPI backend is accessible at http://localhost:8000
  - And the NextJS frontend is accessible at http://localhost:3000
  - And the database schema is created with all required tables
  - And hot reloading works for both frontend and backend code changes
  - But no user data exists until manually created or seeded

#### Scenario: [x] API Health Check Verification
- **Given** the development environment is running
- **When** a GET request is made to http://localhost:8000/health
- **Then** the API responds with 200 OK status
  - And returns a JSON response with service status information
  - And database connectivity is confirmed

#### Scenario: [x] Database Migration Application
- **Given** the application is starting for the first time
- **When** the database initialization process runs
- **Then** all required tables are created (channels, downloads, download_history, application_settings)
  - And proper indexes are applied for performance
  - And foreign key relationships are established correctly

#### Scenario: [x] Frontend-Backend Communication
- **Given** both frontend and backend services are running
- **When** the frontend makes an API call to the backend
- **Then** CORS is properly configured to allow the request
  - And the response is received successfully
  - And TypeScript types match the API response structure

#### Scenario: [x] Container Build Failure
- **Given** there is an error in the Docker configuration
- **When** attempting to build or start the containers
- **Then** clear error messages are displayed
  - And logs indicate the specific failure point
  - And the developer can identify the issue from the error output

### Non-functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Backend starts within 10 seconds, frontend builds in under 30 seconds
- **Security:** CORS configured appropriately, no sensitive data in environment variables
- **Reliability:** Services restart automatically on failure, database maintains data integrity
- **Usability:** Single command startup, clear error messages, comprehensive development documentation

### Engineering TODOs
- Choose between SQLAlchemy vs raw SQL for database operations
- Decide on React Query vs SWR for frontend data fetching
- Determine logging format (JSON vs plain text for development)
- Plan for future PostgreSQL migration path

## Section 2: Engineering Tasks

### Task Breakdown
*Each task should follow INVEST principles (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)*

#### 1. [x] Docker Configuration - Containerized Development Environment
- **Description:** Create Docker containers and docker-compose configuration that allows 100% containerized development. Set up basic project structure, Dockerfiles for both services, and development environment without requiring local Python/Node installations.
- **Estimation:** 3-4 hours
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [x] Project directory structure created with backend/ and frontend/ folders
  - [x] Backend Dockerfile with Python environment and development dependencies
  - [x] Frontend Dockerfile with Node.js environment for NextJS development
  - [x] docker-compose.dev.yml that starts both services with volume mounts for hot reloading
  - [x] Database volume persists data between container restarts
  - [x] All development can be done without installing Python/Node locally
  - [x] Clear README with Docker-only setup instructions

#### 2. [x] Backend Foundation - FastAPI Application Setup
- **Description:** Create FastAPI application with proper project structure, dependency management, and basic configuration inside the Docker container. Include SQLAlchemy setup with SQLite database and Alembic for migrations.
- **Estimation:** 4-6 hours
- **Acceptance Criteria:** 
  - [x] FastAPI app starts without errors on port 8000 inside container
  - [x] Health check endpoint returns 200 OK with system status
  - [x] SQLAlchemy connects to SQLite database successfully
  - [x] Alembic migration system is configured and working
  - [x] Environment variable configuration is functional
  - [x] All development commands work via docker compose exec

#### 3. [x] Database Schema and Models - Core Data Structure
- **Description:** Design and implement the core database schema with SQLAlchemy models for channels, downloads, download_history, and application_settings. Create initial migration and establish relationships.
- **Estimation:** 3-4 hours
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [x] All four core tables created with proper data types
  - [x] Foreign key relationships established between related tables
  - [x] Database indexes created for common query patterns
  - [x] Initial migration runs successfully from empty database via Docker
  - [x] Pydantic schemas created for API request/response validation

#### 4. [x] Frontend Foundation - NextJS Application Setup
- **Description:** Initialize NextJS project with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and basic routing structure inside the Docker container. Configure API client for backend communication and establish component architecture.
- **Estimation:** 3-4 hours
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - [x] NextJS application builds and runs on port 3000 inside container
  - [x] TypeScript configuration is strict and properly configured
  - [x] TailwindCSS is integrated and working with custom styles
  - [x] Basic layout components and routing structure exists
  - [x] API client can successfully call backend health endpoint
  - [x] Hot reloading works for both code and style changes via volume mounts
