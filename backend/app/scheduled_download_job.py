"""Scheduled download job with three-tier error handling.

This module implements the main scheduled job that processes all enabled channels
and downloads new videos. It integrates with the existing video_download_service
and uses the overlap prevention mechanism to prevent concurrent executions.

Three-Tier Error Handling:
1. Job Level: Prevent overlaps, continue on individual channel failures
2. Channel Level: Log errors, update history, continue with next channel
3. Video Level: Log errors, continue with next video (handled in video_download_service)

Key Features:
- Sequential channel processing (prevents system overload)
- Individual channel error isolation
- Retry logic for transient errors
- Comprehensive job statistics
- Integration with overlap prevention
- DownloadHistory tracking for all runs

Usage:
    This job is scheduled by SchedulerService and runs automatically
    based on the cron schedule in ApplicationSettings.
